# Memory cards game

Just some extremely simple but fun games that my daughter Lena enjoys üë®‚Äçüëß.

Built with [NEXT.JS](https://nextjs.org/)

## Memory
> Memory starts with a grid of cards where you have to find image pairs. The game finish when all the pairs have been discovered.

## Tic-Tac-Toe
> Tic-Tac-Toe starts with a grid with 3 rows and 3 columns, each turn, you draw your symbol (X or O) in one of the empty cells on the game board. You can start anywhere you like. The goal is to make a line of three of your symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
